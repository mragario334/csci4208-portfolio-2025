# Proposal â€” capstone-01

**Team repo:** [https://github.com/mragario334/AdvancedWebApps](https://github.com/mragario334/AdvancedWebApps)  
**Project (v2) board:** [https://github.com/users/mragario334/projects/6/views/1](https://github.com/users/mragario334/projects/6/views/1)

## Team Roster
- Blake Tapie

## Deliverables for this phase
- **Wireframes and UI mockups** showing the main user flows (home page, group creation, scheduling, dashboard).  
- **Database schema design** including tables for users, groups, sessions, and progress tracking.  
- **Basic authentication system** allowing users to sign up, log in, and join study groups.  

## Summary (what I produced)
- Produced interactive wireframes demonstrating the user journey from account creation to scheduling study sessions.  
- Designed the database schema supporting users, groups, sessions, and progress logs.  
- Implemented the initial authentication flow with email/password.  
- Set up the GitHub repo with folder structure, README, and a Kanban board for task tracking.  

## Evidence / Artifacts
- No evidence yet as this is just the proposal for the project  

## Notes & Risks
- **Scope creep:** Adding advanced features like notifications or calendar sync may extend development time.  
- **User adoption:** Initial testing requires active users to form study groups.  
- **Security:** Authentication is basic; password hashing and session security need to be implemented before deployment.
